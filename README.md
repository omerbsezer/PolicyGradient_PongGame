# Policy Gradient Implementation Using Gym and Tensorflow
Policy gradient network is implemented using popular atari game, Pong Game.  "Policy gradients method involves running a policy for a while, seeing what actions lead to high rewards, increasing their probability through backpropagating gradients". If there is a large scale problems which is aimed to solve, a type of function approximator should be used. In this problem, a neural network is used as function approximator. There are too many states and/or actions to store in memory, so look up table can not be used.

Policy Gradient Neural Network, based on Andrejâ€™s solution, will do:

- take in images from the game and "preprocess" them (remove color, background, etc).
- use the TF NN to compute a probability of moving up or down.
- sample from that probability distribution and tell the agent to move up or down.
- if the round is over, find whether you won or lost.
- when the episode has finished, pass the result through the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradient for weights.
- after each episodes have finished, sum up the gradient and move the weights in the direction of the gradient.
- repeat this process until weights are tuned to the point

# PongGame Experiment Results
After a period time, scores are getting better.
